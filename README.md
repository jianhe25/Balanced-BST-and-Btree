# Overview
This is a self balanced tree demonstration system. The system can be used as a demonstration tool for data structure course, the system supports following trees:

* BST
* Treap
* AVL tree
* B tree

All of these trees are represented by a graphical tree, I use circles with a number to denote node, and straight line to denote branches. the sample is below

## Btree

The system also supports the efficiency comparison of different trees, displayed with histogram.

This is my data structure course project in 2011.
