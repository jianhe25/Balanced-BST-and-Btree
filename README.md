# Overview
This is a self balanced tree and B tree demonstration system. The system can be used as a demonstration tool for data structure course, it supports following trees:

* BST
* Treap
* AVL tree
* B tree

All of these trees are represented by a graphical interface, I use circles with a number to denote node, and straight line to denote branches.

## AVL tree

## Btree

The system also supports the efficiency comparison of different trees, displayed with histogram.

## Time Comparison when inserts 2000 numbers.

This is my data structure course project in 2011.
