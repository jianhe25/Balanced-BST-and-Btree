{"body":"# Overview\r\nThis is a self balanced tree demonstration system. The system can be used as a demonstration tool for data structure course, the system supports following trees:\r\n\r\n* BST\r\n* Treap\r\n* AVL tree\r\n* B tree\r\n\r\nAll of these trees are represented by a graphical tree, I use circles with a number to denote node, and straight line to denote branches. the sample is below\r\n\r\nThe system also supports the efficiency comparison of different trees, displayed with histogram.\r\n\r\nThis is my data structure course project in 2011.\r\n","name":"Balanced-bst-and-btree","google":"","tagline":"An animated demonstration of balanced BST and Btree, support AVL, Treap, BST, B tree","note":"Don't delete this file!
