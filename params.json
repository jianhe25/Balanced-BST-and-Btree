{"body":"# Overview\r\nThis is a self balanced tree demonstration system. The system can be used as a demonstration tool for data structure course, the system supports following trees:\r\n\r\n* BST\r\n* Treap\r\n* AVL tree\r\n* B tree\r\n\r\nAll of these trees are represented by a graphical tree, I use circles with a number to denote node, and straight line to denote branches. the sample is below\r\n\r\n## AVL tree\r\n![AVL tree](https://raw.github.com/jianhe25/Balanced-BST-and-Btree/master/raw/images/overview.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Btree\r\n![Btree](https://raw.github.com/jianhe25/Balanced-BST-and-Btree/master/raw/images/Btree.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe system also supports the efficiency comparison of different trees, displayed with histogram.\r\n\r\n## Time Comparison when inserts 2000 numbers.\r\n![Statistics](https://raw.github.com/jianhe25/Balanced-BST-and-Btree/master/raw/images/Statistics.jpg)\r\nThis is my data structure course project in 2011.\r\n","name":"Balanced-bst-and-btree","google":"","tagline":"An animated demonstration of balanced BST and Btree, support AVL, Treap, BST, B tree","note":"Don't delete this file!
